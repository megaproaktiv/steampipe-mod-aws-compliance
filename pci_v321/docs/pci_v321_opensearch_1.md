## Description

This control checks whether Amazon OpenSearch domains are in a VPC. It does not evaluate the VPC subnet routing configuration to determine public access.

You should ensure that Amazon OpenSearch domains are not attached to public subnets. See [Resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ac.html#ac-types-resource) in the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.

You also should ensure that your VPC is configured according to the recommended best practices. See [Security best practices for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.html) in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Amazon OpenSearch domains deployed within a VPC can communicate with VPC resources over the private AWS network, without the need to traverse the public internet. This configuration increases the security posture by limiting access to the data in transit. VPCs provide a number of network controls to secure access to Amazon OpenSearch domains, including network ACL and security groups. Security Hub recommends that you migrate public Amazon OpenSearch domains to VPCs to take advantage of these controls.

## Remediation

If you create a domain with a public endpoint, you cannot later place it within a VPC. Instead, you must create a new domain and migrate your data. The reverse is also true. If you create a domain within a VPC, it cannot have a public endpoint. Instead, you must either [create another domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html#es-createdomains) or disable this control.
